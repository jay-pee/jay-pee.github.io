Learning Chinese radicals is a great first step when learning the Chinese language. It can help you understand the structure of characters and form mnemonics for easier memorization in the future. The deck includes stroke order examples and high-quality audio for each radical, to give you the opportunity learning with different senses. I used Python to auto-generate this deck from various APIs and data sources. Take a look at the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jay-pee/Anki-Chinese-Radicals-Deck-Plus) and find the deck on Anki shared decks [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1732259414).
